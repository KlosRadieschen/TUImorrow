3. **Beverageware Obligation**: If you meet the author in person for the first
   time after you have engaged in any of the following activities with the
   software — specifically, use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
   sublicense, or sell — you are obligated to purchase a pint of beer or a large
   coffee for the author (at the author's discretion) at a local establishment
   that serves such beverages at the time of the first meeting, unless both
   parties agree to delay.

   3.1 **Large Coffee Definition**: A "large coffee" is defined as at least **350 ml**
       (approximately **11.8 fluid ounces**).

   3.2 **Establishment Selection**: The author reserves a maximum of **5 minutes** to
       select an establishment on the spot, in addition to the **15 minutes** of
       walking time thereafter.

   3.3 **Local Definition**: "Local" is defined as any establishment within
       walking distance from the point of meeting, where "walking distance"
       means a distance that can be covered in **15 minutes** or less, assuming
       an average walking speed of **5 km/h** (3.1 mph).

   3.4 **Size Limitation**: If the establishment serves the beverage but only in
       sizes smaller than those specified, you are obligated to purchase the
       largest available option for the author.

   3.5 **Closed Establishment**: In case the chosen establishment is closed, the
       obligation is considered fulfilled.

   3.6 **Time Limitations**: If the author does not have time at the moment of
       the meeting and you disagree to delay, the obligation is also considered
       fulfilled.

   3.7 **Route Disagreement**: In case of disagreement regarding the route, the
   most direct accessible pedestrian path will be considered, and the total
   distance shall not exceed **1.25 kilometers** (0.78 miles).

   3.8 **Waiver of Obligation**: If no such establishment is available, or if
       the author explicitly waives the request in writing or verbally in the
       presence of independent witnesses — defined as individuals who have no
       personal, familial, or financial relationship with either party — the
       obligation to purchase the beer or coffee for the author is considered
       fulfilled.

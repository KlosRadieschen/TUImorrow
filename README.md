I am archiving this because I am more focused on other projects at the moment and I am not sure if I will return to this

This is WIP. The code is far from being usable at all
# Why?
I wanted an interesting project to learn Kotlin.
I also wanted a simple/minimalistc To-Do app that can be navigated quickly with keybinds. It is a TUI app because terminal is cool and it's easier to implement any kind of graphical interface. It also makes the keybinds feel more natural.
